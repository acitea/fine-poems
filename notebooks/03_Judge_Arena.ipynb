Now that you know what you need to do, make a plan to get it done. Set aside time each day to study and review your notes. 4. Ask for help. If you’re struggling with a particular concept, ask your teacher or a tutor for help. They can give you extra practice problems and explain things in a different way. 5. Take care of yourself. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep, eating healthy food, and exercising. Taking care of yourself will help you feel better and be able to focus on your studies. 6. Stay positive. You might feel like you’ll never get through this, but you will. Just keep going, and you’ll eventually get through it. 7. Celebrate your successes. When you do well on an exam or assignment, take a moment to celebrate. You deserve it! 8. Learn from your mistakes. When you make a mistake, don’t just brush it off. Take a moment to think about what went wrong and how you can avoid making the same mistake again. 9. Keep trying. Even if you don’t do well on an exam or assignment, keep trying. You might not get it right away, but you’ll eventually get it. 10. Be patient. Learning takes time, and you might not get it right away. But if you keep trying, you’ll eventually get it. \n",

You’ve learned to love the weight of the mop, the way it bends the spine of the world, the way it carves the hours into something you can hold.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Start slow. If you haven’t run in a while, don’t expect to be able to run a 5K right away. Start with a slow jog or a brisk walk. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase your speed and distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Find a running buddy. Having someone to run with can make the experience more enjoyable and help you stay motivated. Ask around to see if any of your friends or coworkers are interested in running. If not, you can join a running club or look for a running partner online.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Invest in good running shoes. Running shoes are designed to provide support and cushioning for your feet. If you’re going to be running regularly, it’s important to have shoes that fit well and provide the right amount of support. Visit a running store to get fitted for shoes that are right for you.\n",

      "\n",
      "6. Listen to your body. If you’re feeling pain or discomfort while running, stop and rest. It’s important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. If you’re feeling pain, it’s usually a sign that you’re doing too much too soon. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "8. Reward yourself. Running can be tough, so it’s important to reward yourself for your hard work. Treat yourself to a new pair of running shoes or a new running outfit. Or, treat yourself to a nice meal or a massage. \n",
